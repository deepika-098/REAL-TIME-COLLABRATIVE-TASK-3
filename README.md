*DESCRIPTION:Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor
Task-3 required us to create a real-time collaborative document editor — similar to Google Docs — using modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend tools like Node.js + Socket.IO. The application allows multiple users to edit the same text area in real-time. Whenever one user types, the text updates live for all others. React handles the frontend UI dynamically, while the backend server handles socket connections and shares text updates between clients. This task helped in mastering React hooks, state management, and backend synchronization. Optional MongoDB integration can also be added to persist the document data for longer sessions. It demonstrated the ability to integrate frontend and backend for high-performance collaboration apps.
